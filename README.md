 # 🖼️ LSB Image Steganography using C

A command-line based **Image Steganography** application developed in C, designed to hide and extract secret data inside images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique.
This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in C programming, bitwise operations, and binary file handling.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

The **LSB Image Steganography** application enables users to securely embed secret text data into BMP images and later retrieve it without causing any noticeable change in image quality.
By modifying only the least significant bits of image pixels, the application ensures data confidentiality while preserving visual integrity.

This project was developed as part of the C Programming module in the Embedded Systems Professional Course at **Emertxe Information Technologies**.

## 🎯 Objective

- To implement **LSB-based image steganography** using **C**  
- To understand **bit-level manipulation** and **binary image formats** 
- To apply file handling concepts in a security-related application
- To ensure secure data hiding without affecting image quality

---

## ✨ Features

- Hide secret text data inside BMP images 
- Extract hidden data accurately from encoded images  
- Uses Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique 
- Supports BMP image format  
- Display all stored contacts  
- Command-line based and user-friendly interface  
- Input validation and error handling

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

- ***C Programming***
- ***Bitwise Operations***
- ***Binary File Handling***
- ***File I/O (fopen, fread, fwrite, fseek)***
- ***Structures***
- ***Pointers and Memory Management***

---

## 🧠 How the Application Works

- Image files are processed in binary mode
- Secret data is converted into individual bit
- Each bit of secret data is embedded into the LSB of image bytes
- Only the least significant bits are modified, preserving image quality
- During decoding, LSBs are read back to reconstruct the original data
- Encoding and decoding are handled using separate logical modules

## ▶️ Compilation and Execution

### Compile:
```bash
gcc *.c -o steganography
```

### Run:
#### Encode(Hide Secret Data): 
```bash
./steganography -e source.bmp secret.txt encoded.bmp
```
##### └──>Ex:
```bash
./steganography -e beautiful.bmp secret.txt stego_imag.bmp
```

#### Decode(Extract Secret Data):
```bash
./steganography -d encoded.bmp output.txt
```
##### └──>Ex:
   ```bash
   ./steganography -d stego_imag.bmp output.txt
   ```

## Learning Outcome and Impact

This project strengthened my understanding of **bitwise manipulation**, **binary file processing**, and **data encoding techniques**.
It improved my problem-solving approach, debugging skills, and confidence in developing **low-level security-oriented applications** using **C**.
